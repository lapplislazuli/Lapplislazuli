### Hi There! I'm Leonhard. :wave:

Welcome to my Github Profile. 

Right now I am a Research Fellow at the [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Roychoudhury](https://abhikrc.com/) in the [Trustworthy and Secure Software Group](https://nus-tss.github.io/). I'll be working mostly on automated programming and automated program repair with AI components.
I got my PhD at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the [Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) where I worked in the [CISELab](https://www.ciselab.nl/). 
My thesis is titled [Tool-Driven Quality Assurance for Functional Programming & Machine Learning](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Leonhard+Applis+Tool-Driven+Quality+Assurance+for+Functional+Programming+%26+Machine+Learning), and consist of half work on testing Models of Code and half tooling in and for Haskell. 
Some of my coolest work is with [Matthi](https://github.com/Tritlo) on improving tooling for Haskell! 

I like: 

- :coffee: Java & :purple_heart: Haskell
- :mag: Testing
- :busts_in_silhouette: Humans
- :funeral_urn: Pottery

I try to do everything open source, so most of the repositories you see here have ![badgeD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-lime) . 

If you want to reach me, you can either 
- :email: email me at the emails on my github profile (Sorry, but they change a lot for researchers ðŸ¤”)
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Open an issue anywhere around and @ me
- :wave: find me somewhere in singapore, or stop me at a conference.
