### Hi There! I'm Leonhard. :wave:

Welcome to my Github Profile. 

I am currently doing my PhD at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the [Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) where I work in the [CISELab](https://www.ciselab.nl/). 
My research track is labelled _"AI Testing and Testing AI"_ - So I do twice the AI and twice the Testing that other researchers do. 
I am very much the Thermomix of Software Engineering AI.
But recently, I have spent most of my work-time with [Matthi](https://github.com/Tritlo) on improving tooling for Haskell! 

I like: 

- :coffee: Java & :purple_heart: Haskell
- :mag: Testing
- :busts_in_silhouette: Humans 

I try to do everything open source, so most of the repositories you see here have ![badgeD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-lime) . 

If you want to reach me, you can either 
- :email: email me at L.H.Applis@tudelft.nl
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Open an issue anywhere around and @ me
