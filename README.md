Welcome to my Github Profile. 

I was a bit bored lately, so I added this readme. 
If that sounds weird - well, it's weirder that you read it. So that's that.

I am currently doing my PhD at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the [Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) where I work in the [CISELab](https://www.ciselab.nl/). 
My research track is labelled _"AI Testing and Testing AI"_ - So I do twice the AI and twice the Testing that other researchers do. 
I am very much the Thermomix of Software Engineering AI.

I like: 

- :coffee: Java & :purple_heart: Haskell
- :mag: Testing
- :busts_in_silhouette: Humans 

I dislike: 

- :shit: Tech Bros 
- :rage: Capitalism

I try to do everything open source, so most of the repositories you see here have ![badgeD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-lime) . 



If you want to reach me, you can either 
- :email: email me at L.H.Applis@tudelft.nl
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Open an issue anywhere around and @ me
